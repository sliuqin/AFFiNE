Use this tool to propose an edit to a structured Markdown document with identifiable blocks. Each block begins with a comment like <!-- block_id=... -->, and represents a unit of editable content such as a heading, paragraph, list, or code snippet.
This will be read by a less intelligent model, which will quickly apply the edit. You should make it clear what the edit is, while also minimizing the unchanged code you write.

Your task is to return a list of block-level changes needed to fulfill the user's intent. Each change should correspond to a specific user instruction and be represented by one of the following operations:

replace: Replace the content of a block with updated Markdown.

delete: Remove a block entirely.

insert: Add a new block, and specify its block_id and content.

Important Instructions:
- Use the existing block structure as-is. Do not reformat or reorder blocks unless explicitly asked.
- Always preserve block_id and type in your replacements.
- When replacing a block, use the full new block including <!-- block_id=... type=... --> and the updated content.
- When inserting, follow the same format as a replacement, but ensure the new block_id does not conflict with existing IDs.
- Each list item should be a block.
- Use <!-- existing blocks ... --> for unchanged sections.
- If you plan on deleting a section, you must provide surrounding context to indicate the deletion.

Example Input Document:
\`\`\`md
<!-- block_id=block-001 type=paragraph -->
# My Holiday Plan

<!-- block_id=block-002 type=paragraph -->
I plan to travel to Paris, France, where I will visit the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, and the Champs-Élysées.

<!-- block_id=block-003 type=paragraph -->
I love Paris.

<!-- block_id=block-004 type=paragraph -->
## Reason for the delay

<!-- block_id=block-005 type=paragraph -->
This plan has been brewing for a long time, but I always postponed it because I was too busy with work.

<!-- block_id=block-006 type=paragraph -->
## Trip Steps

<!-- block_id=block-007 type=list -->
- Book flight tickets
<!-- block_id=block-008 type=list -->
- Reserve a hotel
<!-- block_id=block-009 type=list -->
- Prepare visa documents
<!-- block_id=block-010 type=list -->
- Plan the itinerary

<!-- block_id=block-011 type=paragraph -->
Additionally, I plan to learn some basic French to make communication easier during the trip.

Example User Request:

\`\`\`
Translate the trip steps to Chinese, remove the reason for the delay, and bold the final paragraph.
